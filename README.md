# HOW TO GENERATE JWT TOKEN

## 1. Start the Spring application
## 2. Generate token by hitting the POST API: localhost:8080/auth/login with below JSON body
{
"username": "user",
"password": "password"
}
## 3. Copy the token from the response body
## 4.  Hit further APIs





# Personal Book List with Google Books Integration

## Context
You have a Spring Boot project with a REST endpoint `/books` that returns
all books from an in-memory H2 database. The code includes a `Book` entity,
`BookRepository`, `BookController`, and a Google Books integration (`/books/google`)
exposing a search that returns the upstream Google schema via `GoogleBookService`.

## Using the Google Books API
* Base URL: `https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1`
* Search endpoint: `GET /volumes?q={query}` (e.g., `q=effective+java`, optional `maxResults`, `startIndex`).
* Volume details endpoint: `GET /volumes/{id}` to fetch a single book by Google volume ID.
* This project uses `GoogleBookService` with a configurable base URL. Set
  `google.books.base*url` in `application.properties` (or override in tests)
  to point to the real API or a mock server. The search route is exposed as
  `GET /google?q={query}` returning the upstream Google schema.

## Task
Implement the following, with accompanying tests for each change (tests are
mandatory):

1. Add a new REST endpoint that takes a Google Books volume ID as a parameter
   and adds the book to your personal list.

   * Endpoint: `POST /books/{googleId}` (path variable `googleId`).
   * Behavior:
       * Fetch the book details from the Google Books API (via `GoogleBookService`).
       * Map appropriate fields from `GoogleBook` to your `Book` entity
       (e.g., id, title, first author, pageCount).
       * Persist the mapped `Book` using `BookRepository`.
       * Return `201 Created` with the persisted `Book` in the response body.
   * Tests (Spring Boot tests):
       * Happy path: valid `googleId` returns 201 and persists the book with
       correct fields.
       * Error path: invalid or missing upstream data returns an appropriate
       error (e.g., `400 Bad Request`), and nothing is persisted.
       * Prefer mocking the downstream (e.g., MockWebServer/WireMock) to avoid
       flakiness; a smoke test hitting the real API is optional.

2. Keep existing functionality intact and verify:

   * The existing `GET /books` endpoint still returns all persisted books.
   * The Google search endpoint `/google` continues to return the
     Google schema payload as-is.
   * Tests should seed data where needed and assert on JSON responses and
     status codes.

You may refactor or add code as needed, but keep the existing structure.
Aim to complete within 30 minutes.
